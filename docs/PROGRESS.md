# Progress: PrintBack refactor (BLE + SD + Flutter)

- [x] Phase 0: starting documentation (project rules index, docs/DECISIONS.md,
      docs/LEARNINGS.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/TASKS.md,
      docs/ARCHITECTURE.md/docs/DATA_MODEL.md skeletons, local rules notes) (2026-07-02)
- [x] Phase 0.5: tooling (`refactor/ble-sd-flutter` branch, dev_cycle.py,
      pre-commit MAC-leak guard, host test harness + kanon.c example) (2026-07-02)
- [x] Phase 1: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DATA_MODEL.md, README.md,
      docs/DECISIONS.md D6/D7, see docs/TASKS.md (2026-07-04)
- [x] Phase 2: SD card logging (2026-07-08). SPI SD card mount
      (`sd_storage.c`), raw record write path, path/purge logic + host
      tests (`sd_paths.c`), Kconfig pins/retention/wallclock fallback,
      wired into `on_probe()`. Verified on real hardware: mount succeeds
      (`SD ready: MSSD0, 59700MB`), a raw record write lands
      (`sd_bytes=16` after one record), rotation opens a new day's file,
      and purge deletes an aged-out file (clock advanced 2 days,
      retention set to 1 day for the test: `purge: deleted 1 raw log
      file(s)`). Existing mechanisms (WiFi sniff, whitelist, watchdogs)
      unaffected. Hit and fixed one real bug along the way: FAT short
      (8.3) filenames don't fit `YYYY-MM-DD.bin`, switched to
      `YYYYMMDD.bin`, see docs/LEARNINGS.md.
- [ ] Phase 3: on-device aggregation, drop raw MAC
- [ ] Phase 4: BLE GATT server
- [ ] Phase 5: pairing button + bonding
- [ ] Phase 6: mobile Flutter skeleton
- [ ] Phase 7: docs/compliance/README.md + README.md, final documentation

Note: the current code in `firmware/` and `app/` is still the old
architecture (USB-CDC → Python desktop dashboard, SQLite). Don't remove /
change it until the new path (BLE+SD) is ready and tested in parallel.
